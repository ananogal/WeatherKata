# Weather Kata

Display the Weather of all capital cities of the UE.

Using the DarkSky weather API, build an iOS app which shows the current weather in all capital cities of the UE. Show them in a list where you can see this data for each city:
Temperature, humidity, chance of rain.

(I decided to add an image to the cell... it's always good to have a visual of the weather :) )
