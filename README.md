# Weather Kata

This is the exercise used in the [blog post]( http://www.ananogal.com/blog/ios-kata/)


### The exercise

Using the [DarkSky weather API](https://developer.forecast.io/docs/v2), build an iOS app which shows the current weather in all capital cities of the UE.
Show them in a list where you can see this data for each city:

-----------------------------------------
Lisbon
22oC, 54% humidity, 10% chance of rain.
-----------------------------------------
Paris
25oC, 66% humidity, 23% chance of rain
-----------------------------------------

Next to each city, you should display an icon that shows the current weather ( you can use just a colored square ).
